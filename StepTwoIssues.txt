ok so here's the deal:

1. need to figure out why extra epsilon is being put on lines it shouldn't
	- i think it's because if a nonterminal has an epsilon in it, and then
	another nonterminal has that nonterminal character in it, then it places an epislon there too

		ie
	A-> S | $
	S-> A
=====
	A-> S
	S-> A | $

dollar sign, epsilon, shouldn't be there

2. a lot of epsilons get placed like A$A, $a, blah blah blah
	- so, do we get rid of all the epsilon terminals that have multiple things in them?
		- and then calculate what extra stuff should be put on the lines
	- or, do we calculate what needs to go on the lines, trying to find a correlation between what the
	program is doing now and what we need it to do.
